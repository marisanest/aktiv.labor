# AKT!V LABOR

This project was developed in the frame of a multidisciplinary semester course with [Fu Berlin and KHB Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de) and [KHB Berlin](https://www.kh-berlin.de). The goal of this course was to design a neo-analogue product embedded in the context of "Smart City".

## CHALLANGE

To address this topic we defined the following challenge for our project:

> How can we sensitize the senses of school children through playful learning to strengthen their knowledge of mobility and skills?

## PRODUCTS

In response to this challenge, we developed three tool: Höribus, Orienta and Distanzo. Höribus...

Watch our product [video]() to get a better insight, how these tools work.

## HARDWARE & SOFTWARE

All tools content Ardunio hardware. To be able to run the code on these tools, the follwing hardware is needed for each tool.

#### Höribus

* Arduino Uno
* Adafruit Music Maker MP3 Shield
* Adafruit Mono Amplifier
* 3-axis Accelerometer
* SD card
* 9V Battery
* Speaker

#### Orienta

* Arduino Uno
* Adafruit Music Maker MP3 Shield
* Adafruit Mono Amplifier
* Hall sensor
* SD card
* 9V Battery
* Speaker
* Magnet

#### Distanzo

* Arduino Mini
* Lidar sensor
* 3-axis Accelerometer
* 4 digit display
* Switch
* 9V Battery

Watch our functional [video](https://vimeo.com/392459920) to better understand, how the hardware is tide together.

## INSTALLATION

All tools are programmed with Arduino. So you first need to install the Arduini IDE on your computer. Then you connect each tool with your computer and run the respective source code on them. For Höribus use the sound.io, for Orienta the path.io and for Distanzo the distance.io file.
